                <li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> Your name, profile picture, and any other information you
                    have

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your social login information for as long as your gym management system account is active. You can
                delete your account at any time, and we will remove your associated social media data from our systems.</p>
